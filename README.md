#Recursion file

In this code we use recursion to calculate how many books a student could get with the amount of money he/she has. We also consider that for each book you get it can count as a point for you to get more.
<br>An example would be: 
<br>Student A has $20 and each book costs $4, for every 2 books you get, you'll have another one for free. Than, we would buy 5 books with 20 dolars, and get more 2 books for free. But since we got another 2 books, we could have a last one for free also. Than in total we could get 8 books, with the set parameters.
